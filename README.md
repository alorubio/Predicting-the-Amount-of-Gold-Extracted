# Predicting the Amount of Gold Extracted

## Objective
To prototype a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.

The model should predict the amount of gold extracted from gold ore.

The model will help optimize production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

To solve the problem, the sMAPE metric, or symmetric mean absolute percentage error, will be used.

Two values ​​will be predicted:

- The recovery of the rougher concentrate (rougher.output.recovery).
- The final recovery of the final concentrate (final.output.recovery).
